# 🍖 UnsortedCannibals Mod

> A Minecraft horror survival mod commissioned by **UnsortedGuy**.

**UnsortedCannibals** introduces dynamic, dangerous **tribal cannibal factions** into your Minecraft world. From **voice-mimicking hunters** to **dart gun-wielding frenzied stalkers**, survival takes a sinister turn. Inspired by the game **The Forest**.

---

## 🧠 Concept

Scattered across the world, **cannibal tribes** spawn in handcrafted camps and ritual sites, similar to villages. But unlike friendly villagers, these tribes want one thing: **you** — well, you *as meat*.

---

## 🗺️ Tribes and Biome Integration

- Tribes generate like villages in forests, jungles, and plains.
- There are a multitude of tribe variants with unique **architecture**, **totems**, and **decor**.
- Traps and **ritual structures** lurk throughout the world.

## 🔥 Cannibal Types

### 1. **The Crave** – Agile Hunter
- Carries a **serrated spear** that causes **Visceral Pain** (damage on movement).
- Can **climb walls** and **mimic passive mob sounds** (pigs, cows, etc.) to lure players.
- Moves quickly and works in packs.

### 2. **The Yearn** – Brutal Butcher
- Slower but extremely strong.
- Hits drag targets **toward them**.
- Easily distracted by **severed noses** or **reeking flesh**.
- High health, inflicts shattered bones when attacking, rendering the target immobile for a while.

### 3. **The Frenzy** – Shadow Stalker
- Fast, unpredictable movement.
- Carries a rare **dart gun** (drops occasionally).

## 💀 Gameplay Tips

- **Don't trust the sounds** — if you hear a cow, it might be a Crave.
- **Stock up on long-range weapons** — close encounters with a Yearn usually end badly.
- **Look for bait traps** — any sudden mob silence might be a setup.
